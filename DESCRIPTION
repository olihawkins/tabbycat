Description: A small library of functions for tabulating and summarising 
    categorical variables. Most of the functions are designed to work with 
    dataframes, and use the tidyverse idiom of taking the dataframe as the 
    first argument so they work within pipelines. Equivalent functions that 
    operate directly on vectors are also provided where it makes sense. This
    package aims to make exploratory data analysis involving categorical
    variables quicker, simpler and more robust.
